# cavOS
## Purpose:
This is an OS I am making in my free time purely for fun. I learnt a bunch of things about OS developement while writting it. 

## Status:
For now it is just another barely functional OS with a non so extendable shell. Every utility is build into the kernel so no unix-style there.

It needs a lot of polishing, time, and lines of code to be an OS that you could dual boot with your current installation. 

## How to use it:
Everything about this can be found over on ``docker/install.md``. Go there for more info about using the docker enviroment building the OS correctly, cleaning unused binaries and other stuff. 

## License:
Since this is still in pre-beta state I really don't know where this kernel is going. We'll see about publishing for the public to see. But my main interest of this project is to have fun and learn things. 

**(Please do not steal my code as I really don't have the time to find and kill you irl)**
